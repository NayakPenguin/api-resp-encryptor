## `Integrated` Encryption Algorithms 

- ### 1. Adding value 15 to all characters, cyclic (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/NayakPenguin" target="_blank">@NayakPenguin</a>)
  The encryption model employed here involves a simple yet effective technique of adding a cyclic value of 15 to each character in the input string. This process applies uniformly to both lowercase and uppercase characters, creating a straightforward and reversible encryption mechanism. The cyclic nature ensures that the shift wraps around, allowing for a seamless transformation while maintaining the integrity of the original character set. While this encryption model may not provide advanced security, it serves as a illustrative example for educational purposes or basic data obfuscation.
